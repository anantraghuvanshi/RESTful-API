# RESTful-API- WIKI 
In this project I have created RESTful API using a node server, mongodb and no front-end was used. 
Robo 3T has been used for GUI of MongoDB and PostMan has been used for CRUD operations without the front-end.
Using express parameters, getting a specific articles, putting a specific article, patching a specific article and deleting a specific article has been performed.
Along with this, normal functionalities like  get, post, update and delete has been implemented.
